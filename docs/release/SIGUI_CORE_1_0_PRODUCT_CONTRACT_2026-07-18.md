## 1. Product statement

MeshCore DeskOS D1L Core 1.0 is a touch-first, non-forwarding MeshCore desk client focused on reliable messaging and local mesh visibility.

A user must be able to:

- power on to a stable Home screen;
- see device, radio, message, and health truth;
- read and compose Public messages on the fixed default Public channel;
- discover a verified node/contact and exchange direct messages;
- see truthful DM delivery/failure state;
- inspect heard nodes and packet activity;
- configure the Canada/USA radio profile;
- retain settings and core message state across reboot;
- recover or reinstall through USB using the packaged instructions.

Core 1.0 must not imply that Map, Wi-Fi, BLE, OTA, administration, multi-channel management, Observer/MQTT, GPS/location, or advanced tools are supported.

## 3. Unavailable capability matrix

The following are unavailable in Core 1.0 and must not be reachable:

| Capability | Required Core behavior |
|---|---|
| Map | No Home/dock/settings entry; no tile worker started |
| Wi-Fi user control | Runtime remains off; mutating commands rejected |
| BLE | Build/package reports unavailable; PR #199 not merged |
| Multi-channel management | Fixed default Public channel only; create/import/export/select/remove hidden/rejected |
| Repeater/room administration | Hidden/rejected; no remote mutation |
| Observer/MQTT | Hidden/rejected; no background task |
| Signed SD update / OTA | Hidden/rejected; USB install/recovery only |
| GPS/location | Hidden/rejected; no location claim |
| Mutable terminal/log UI | Hidden/rejected |
| Advanced QR/emoji | Hidden/rejected |
| User-facing TRACE/PATH tool | Hidden unless a read-only diagnostic is explicitly qualified |
| Notification system | No production claim beyond existing unread counters |

---

## 4. Release-profile authority

Add one immutable capability authority:

```text
main/app/release_profile.h
main/app/release_profile.c
```

The Core build must compile with:

```text
D1L_RELEASE_PROFILE=core_1_0
```

The exact implementation mechanism may use Kconfig, CMake definitions, or a generated header, but it must be:

- deterministic;
- included in package metadata;
- testable from source;
- visible in `version` and `health`;
- bound to the exact Actions artifact;
- impossible for a user setting to change at runtime.

---

## 5. UI rules

Core navigation consists of:

1. Home
2. Messages
3. Nodes
4. Packets
5. Settings/Tools

Messages may contain Public and DM views.

Settings may contain:

- identity summary;
- radio profile;
- retained storage summary;
- display/backlight;
- timezone/fixed offset;
- diagnostics;
- about/version;
- recovery/help.

Unavailable features must be omitted. A read-only capability list may explain that they are planned for later releases.

No dead button may open a partial controller.

---

## 6. Command rules

### Permitted categories

- version, board, health, crashlog;
- display/touch/backlight;
- settings needed by Core;
- identity;
- radio;
- Public and DM message operations;
- contacts/nodes needed by Core;
- packet/route/signal read-only diagnostics;
- storage status and Core-supported retention;
- controlled reboot and documented recovery.

### Rejected categories

Unavailable feature mutations must fail before side effects with:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "code": "ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED",
  "release_profile": "core_1_0",
  "feature": "<id>"
}
```

Read-only status may return `ok=true` with `available=false`, or the bounded unsupported response. It must never imply runtime support.

---

## 7. Storage contract

### Always supported

- settings;
- identity;
- Public and DM retained state within the documented bounded capacity;
- read-state markers;
- contacts needed by Core;
- route state needed by DM;
- crashlog;
- NVS fallback.

### Conditional SD

SD is supported only when the exact final candidate proves:

- correct paired ESP32/RP2040 artifacts;
- FAT32 card present/mounted/root-ready;
- file operations and atomic rename;
- reboot/remount;
- physical removal and reinsertion;
- file canary;
- retained readback;
- stable 30-minute window;
- no format action.

When conditional qualification fails:

- `sd_history=false`;
- UI hides SD data actions;
- package omits RP2040 release payloads;
- NVS remains authoritative;
- release notes state SD is deferred.

---

## 8. RF contract

- D1L is non-forwarding.
- Default region is USA/Canada.
- Automated default Public transmission is prohibited during validation.
- Controlled DM or a configured private `#test` channel is used for RF proof.
- Direct messages must have truthful queued/sent/acknowledged/retrying/failed state.
- No malformed, unauthenticated, duplicate, or replayed payload may create a visible duplicate or incorrect ACK.
- COM8, COM11, and COM29 are forbidden.
- COM12 is the D1L app/console path.
- A controlled peer must use a distinct explicitly assigned allowed path.

---

## 9. Minimum production evidence

Core 1.0 requires:

1. exact Actions workflow green;
2. exact downloaded artifacts and verified checksums;
3. package profile binding;
4. non-erasing COM12 flash receipt;
5. profile-aware core smoke;
6. display/touch manual confirmation;
7. supported UI corruption/navigation/scroll/compose evidence;
8. controlled RF/DM acceptance;
9. reboot/persistence evidence;
10. 60-minute active plus 30-minute idle soak;
11. crash/heap/stack/LVGL health;
12. installation and recovery docs;
13. `core_release_ready=true`;
14. zero known Core P0;
15. zero known Core crash/data-loss/security P1.

The Full Feature audit is expected to remain false.

---

## 10. Release notes minimum

Release notes must include:

- “Core 1.0” in the title;
- exact supported and unavailable matrices;
- SD support state;
- firmware commit;
- Actions run;
- SHA-256 values;
- installation and recovery steps;
- no on-device SD formatting;
- current known limitations;
- support/reporting channel;
- explicit statement that Map, Wi-Fi, BLE, OTA, multi-channel management, administration, Observer/MQTT, and location are deferred.

---

## 11. No-go conditions

Do not tag when:

- exact candidate identity is not proven;
- any core P0 remains;
- any crash/data-loss/security P1 remains;
- DM interoperability is missing;
- unsupported features remain reachable;
- checksums or provenance fail;
- device reboots unexpectedly;
- retained state is lost;
- soak fails;
- SD is advertised without exact SD evidence;
- evidence is stale, simulated, dry-run-only, or from a predecessor SHA;
- forbidden ports or SD formatting are used.
