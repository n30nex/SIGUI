# MeshCore DeskOS D1L User Guide

This firmware turns a Seeed SenseCAP Indicator D1L into a touch-first desk console for a local MeshCore mesh.

## What Works Now

- Canada/USA MeshCore radio profile: 910.525 MHz, BW62.5, SF7, CR5, 20 dBm, TCXO NONE.
- Local MeshCore identity stored in D1L NVS.
- Public MeshCore `test` send/receive against local bots.
- Signed advert receive/transmit.
- Persisted recent Public messages, bounded Public History/Search, DM rows, heard nodes, contacts, routes, packet evidence, unread state, and reset history.
- Messages opens to the Public channel by default, with an explicit DMs mode for retained direct-message conversations and thread review.
- Touch Public/DM compose enforces the 138-character MeshCore limit and shows the current character count.
- Tapping a Public message opens a detail sheet with sender, message text, signal, retained path evidence, and a Reply action that opens Public compose without transmitting until Send.
- Home is a quiet five-destination dashboard: Messages, Network, Map, and More are the task entries, while one Device card summarizes Time, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and SD state. Secondary tools such as Packets and diagnostics are grouped under More instead of competing on the Home screen.
- Targeted outbound DM to a local MeshCore bot has been verified through hardware counters and D1L packet/message logs.
- First-boot setup for node name, Canada/USA preset confirmation, Desk Companion role, offline radio defaults, and local identity generation.
- 480x480 dark touch shell with Home, Messages, Network, Map, More, full-height nested pages, toast feedback, onboarding, and lock overlay.
- More groups Tools, Connections, Storage & maps, Device, Support, and Advanced into simple menus. SD Card opens a quiet Storage page with separate Card status and Data locations subpages; the other leaves remain Wi-Fi, BLE, Radio, Map options, Display, Identity, Diagnostics, About, and Packets.
- Staged touch radio settings editor for frequency, bandwidth, SF, CR, TX power, RX boost, and US/CAN defaults. Saved profile changes are persisted and flagged as reboot/apply pending.
- Mesh visibility summaries for signal, room servers, and repeater candidates. `Packets -> Mesh Roles` opens a two-choice root; Rooms and Repeaters then open separate bounded read-only lists, with Back returning one level at a time.
- Map opens the actual current view with direct `-`, `+`, and `Center` controls plus one `Options` setup action. It starts at regional zoom 10, permits zooms 8 through 14, and pans with a one-finger drag; a drag commits the next view only when the finger is released. `Center` returns to the saved manual location. D1L has no onboard GPS. Coordinates received in valid signed peer adverts can appear as bright role-coloured node markers with high-contrast names below them and are described as `Advert location`, not live GPS. At most eight non-overlapping markers are shown from the 32 newest located nodes; crowded markers are omitted instead of showing an unlabeled dot. Tap within a marker's 44 px viewport hit area to open Node Detail, including its advert coordinates; Close returns to the unchanged retained Map view without intentionally downloading it again. OpenStreetMap Standard remains the built-in source and cache format; decoded tiles receive a deterministic local dark style so no second provider, account, key, or duplicate cache is needed. The setup hierarchy remains `Map -> Map options -> Set location or Cache status` (canonical probes: `map -> map_options -> map_location or map_cache`). Back from either child returns to Map options; Save location returns to the actual Map. With Wi-Fi connected, each committed view may load only its visible current-view 3x3 at one zoom per visible generation, selected by the user. A completed exact-view Home-to-Map revisit reuses the retained rendered frame without network or SD reread, while later sessions reuse cached tiles. There is no background, multi-zoom prefetch, off-screen batch, or area download; `(c) OpenStreetMap contributors` stays visible.
- Packets is now a terminal-style diagnostic feed with RX/TX/fail/error color treatment, filter/search controls, pause/resume, route evidence, and normal/advanced packet detail.
- Network shows role badges for companions, repeaters, room servers, sensors, and unknown nodes, plus a read-only heard-node detail page for role, fingerprint, public-key state, signal, path, and heard-count evidence.
- Read-only route trace helper for promoted contacts or known fingerprints, backed by retained route/contact evidence.
- Contact export for promoted contacts with retained public keys, using MeshCore-compatible `meshcore://contact/add?...` serial output and a touch QR sheet.
- USB serial diagnostics, smoke test, and soak test tooling.

## Release Package Flashing

Use a release package from GitHub Actions or `artifacts/release`.

Normal project flash writes the bootloader, partition table, and app image at ESP-IDF offsets while preserving unrelated flash regions.

```powershell
$env:D1L_PORT = "COMx"
.\flash_project.ps1 -Port $env:D1L_PORT
```

Do not use COM8, COM11, or COM29 for D1L flashing/testing unless the operator explicitly reassigns the hardware. In the current validation setup, use COM12 for the D1L.

The full 8MB image is for factory/recovery workflows and can overwrite persisted settings, contacts, messages, and logs. It requires typed confirmation:

```powershell
$env:D1L_PORT = "COMx"
.\flash_full_8mb.ps1 -Port $env:D1L_PORT
```

## After Flash

Run smoke from the repo checkout:

```powershell
$env:D1L_PORT = "COMx"
python .\scripts\smoke_d1l.py --port $env:D1L_PORT --manual-touch
```

For a short active stability probe with local Public bots that respond to `test`:

```powershell
python .\scripts\soak_d1l.py --port $env:D1L_PORT --duration-sec 180 --sample-interval-sec 45 --active-public-text test --active-interval-sec 60 --require-rx-delta --min-tx-delta 1
```

## Current Limits

Retained Public/DM message history can use SD only behind the ready file-operation gate and always keeps onboard fallback.

- Manual physical review of the touch UI is still pending.
- Hardware pixel capture over the COM12 console is the primary way to prove what the D1L display drew. PR #60 / source `0b138be` passed Actions `29068006554` and `29068007961`, then captured Mesh Roles (`63DE54FB`), Rooms (`FD538D71`), and Repeaters (`5C41EE08`) with matching firmware/host CRCs, passing simulator diffs, and a clean three-round all-tab probe without Public RF or formatting. The newer Storage/Card status/Data locations hierarchy still needs its own exact Actions/COM12 captures and physical Back/scroll review.
- Manual touch review of the Settings dashboard, the new read-only Storage hierarchy, and Radio Settings is still pending.
- Manual touch review of the Contact Edit rename/Forget sheet is still pending.
- Full DM ACK/PATH, direct-route, and inbound-DM RF proof is still pending.
- Route Trace is retained local evidence only; active RF ping/trace commands are not enabled yet.
- Contact export QR scanning/import has not yet been manually proven with a phone/client.
- Wi-Fi is off by default but can be explicitly enabled for local setup, bounded `wifi scan`, saved-profile `wifi connect`, and the touch Wi-Fi Setup sheet. Map has a built-in OpenStreetMap Standard source and no source/account/key editor. Network access is limited to the visible current-view 3x3 at one zoom per visible generation, with the user selecting a level between 8 and 14 while the actual Map is active. Pan and zoom create a new bounded visible-view plan only after the drag is released or a zoom control is tapped; they do not start background or multi-zoom prefetch. BLE companion runtime, OTA, and hardware proof remain pending.
- The saved location persists. Pan and zoom are session view state: Home-to-Map keeps a completed exact view in the retained rendered frame, while a reboot starts again at the saved center and default zoom 10 and may reread tiles from the SD cache. Neither path should duplicate network requests for tiles already cached. A physically opened Map waits without tile or network activity while the complete SD file gate prepares, then resumes that same visible generation automatically; leaving or covering Map cancels the wait. The revised controls, same-view frame reuse, combined ESP-IDF v5.5.4 pixels, and physical request/render/cancel/cache flow remain release gates. Page-open probes are read-only and network-suppressed: no map tile request, no Wi-Fi mutation, no RF, and no storage mutation.
- Optional SD-card data storage is staged but not fully hardware-accepted yet. The touch path is read-only: `More -> Storage & maps -> SD Card` opens Storage, then Card status or Data locations; a fixed footer says DeskOS never formats cards, no raw setup slug is shown, and these pages expose no mount, remount, delete, or format callback. PR #61 / source `4d9f384` proves this hierarchy on exact Actions-built COM12 pixels with passing simulator diffs and moved-and-restored Data scrolling; only manual physical touch/photos remain open for the Storage UI. Current builds also expose `storage status`, `storage map-policy`, non-destructive `storage setup`, and serial-only file/history/map/export canaries, include a GitHub Actions-built RP2040 SD bridge target, and never format SD cards. Users must provide FAT32 cards prepared on a computer. When the bridge reports a ready card plus file-operation and atomic-rename support, retained Public/DM history, routes, packets, exports, and map tiles can report SD backends with onboard fallback. Settings, identity, contacts, and read-state remain onboard/fallback-backed or pending until later migrations.
- Full 12-hour idle/listening soak is still pending; the 1-hour active Public `test` soak has passed.
- Flash backup was intentionally skipped during current bring-up when the operator requested it.
