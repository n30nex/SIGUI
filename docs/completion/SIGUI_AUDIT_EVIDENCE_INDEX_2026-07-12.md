## Snapshot

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Live merged main | `5ee89e3d3956e39cd8eff4c87374d22b3f40613b` through PR #160; exact-main Actions `29460262807` and strict downloaded-artifact gate pass |
| Last strict-verified merged checkpoint included in this pack | `5ee89e3d3956e39cd8eff4c87374d22b3f40613b` / Actions `29460262807` / receipt `dad1a84d81b45a7c5c94e51e2ffb1e8cd28febd4f4f98a4d6a862566aeb38a91` / gate manifest `214deb9d1f74952cec7784de15154e2c36b5cecf5b9de1b9208763c423569284` |
| WP-01 exact source candidate | `092293f2311a24c9899bc9bf343ab014c4ba0411` |
| Open pull requests | None at this snapshot; `codex/wp09-management-ui-evidence` is local and not yet pushed |
| Merged completion slices | PRs #152-#157 bank the WP-09 channel runtime, UI, management, and entropy slices; PR #158 banks fail-closed versioned settings; corrected PR #159 banks compact dock/shared geometry; PR #160 banks retained-wall checkpoint software. No physical/RF/WP-09/WP-11/WP-12/WP-14/release closure is inferred |
| Candidate integration state | Exact main `5ee89e3` includes channel-management software, checksummed version/revision settings with bounded migration and secret handling, corrected 44-pixel dock/shared Map geometry, and approximate retained-wall checkpoint recovery. Full-reset/power-loss/endurance durability, time migration/timezone/authenticated-transport/physical qualification, Home status icons, UI-task/lifecycle/1,000-transition/physical qualification, official-client RF, exact-candidate reboot/reset/recovery, required acceptance artifacts, dependency closure, and release closure remain open |
| Proof-ledger PR | #83 head `a2da533310c7b2e6898439684922b9cd86896b59`, merged as `c3f9106ea9b88c491889cd8dea9ad883a0d72180` |
| Pinned MeshCore | `e8d3c53ba1ea863937081cd0caad759b832f3028` |
| SDK | ESP-IDF 5.5.4 |
| Last banked host suite | Exact-main Actions `29460262807` passed 1,166 host, 32 checksum-contract, and 32 focused retained-time tests, 1,008 wire vectors, 931 oracle checks, and 100,000 wire plus 100,000 advert fuzz inputs with zero findings |
| Last banked candidate CI | At exact main `5ee89e3`, five ZIPs / 46 entries strict-verified across 339 files / 79,775,680 bytes with exact-source provenance and SPDX; strict receipt SHA-256 `dad1a84d81b45a7c5c94e51e2ffb1e8cd28febd4f4f98a4d6a862566aeb38a91`. Provenance is unauthenticated and no SLSA level is claimed |
| Conformance closure | false overall; this pack admits strict-banked software through PR #160, including versioned settings, compact dock/shared geometry, and bounded retained-wall checkpoint recovery. Pinned official-client RF, exact-candidate reboot/reset/recovery and physical UI/time acceptance, required acceptance artifacts, controlled-peer route/TRACE, real RF fallback, multi-hop, remaining Wi-Fi/Map/BLE/display/radio acceptance, WP-07, WP-11, WP-12, WP-14, admin, and final release closure remain open |
| Release status | not ready to tag; the `5ee89e3` dry audit SHA-256 `b128439541a559b6e3ddd05cfbb95827fc5b7415753d4bc9741633b10e5462bd` is fail-closed with 33 P0 / 35 overall; the reproducible reporting estimate is 80% capability implementation / 74% weighted progress, not a gate waiver |

PR #84 merged the hardened baseline/tooling as `17a948cf`; PRs #86/#87 changed release-security/CI inputs, not the runtime qualification boundary. Those physical roles remain deferred to the frozen final candidate. `BLK-WP02-EXACT-HARDWARE-ROLES-20260713` blocks WP-02 completion but not dependent implementation execution, so WP-03 and WP-04 continue while release readiness remains false.

### Stale feature branch

`feature/meshcore-deskos-d1l` has diverged from `main`. It is not a valid bulk merge source. Compare it after the active stack lands; cherry-pick only proven unique desired work, then archive it.

## Source anchors and confirmed conclusions

### Build boundary

**File:** `main/CMakeLists.txt`

Only selected upstream MeshCore Ed25519 C files are compiled into the current product. The upstream Mesh, `BaseChatMesh`, dispatcher, contacts/channels, and session behavior are not the production runtime. Therefore the local protocol implementation needs semantic conformance, not merely source presence.

### Mesh service

**File:** `main/mesh/meshcore_service.c` — about 1,826 lines

Confirmed:

- one hard-coded Public secret/hash path;
- small service queue centered on RX start/raw send;
- outbound DM attempt effectively fixed;
- inbound DM computes ACK data but does not transmit ACK/PATH;
- outbound history/state is advanced before TxDone/ACK truth;
- trace is represented as a normal DM token;
- callbacks perform parsing/store/status work directly;
- mutable service state is accessed through multiple paths.

### Upstream expected behavior

**Files at pinned MeshCore:** `src/helpers/BaseChatMesh.h/.cpp`

Confirmed upstream concepts:

- expected ACK derived from timestamp/message/sender key;
- inbound valid DM sends direct ACK or flood ACK+PATH;
- attempts are encoded, including extended attempt values;
- direct vs flood timeout calculation;
- path return behavior;
- contact lifecycle and channels;
- login/request/response/keepalive session concepts.

### Wire conformance

**File:** `main/mesh/meshcore_wire.c`

Current implementation validates and encodes structural header, transport codes, path length/bytes, and payload. It does not by itself prove crypto, advert, DM, ACK, retry, route, trace, duplicate, replay, or retained-session semantics.

### Boot/application ownership

**File:** `main/app_main.c`

Positive fail-closed initialization exists for NVS, retained NVS, RP2040/SD, stores, radio, connectivity, UI, and console. There is no single immutable capability registry, so partial subsystem failures can be difficult for UI/automation to represent consistently.

### Retained storage

**Files:**

- `main/storage/retained_blob_store.c` — about 1,502 lines
- `main/storage/storage_status.c` — about 1,276 lines
- route/message/DM/packet stores and worker modules

Confirmed strengths:

- dedicated retained NVS partition;
- marker/anchor/sentinel ownership;
- compact NVS fallback;
- SD generations;
- atomic replace;
- no-format policy;
- detailed telemetry.

Confirmed risk:

- behavior is duplicated across stores;
- reboot/quiescence spans multiple tasks/locks;
- the narrow `092293f` WP-01 exact-pair repair is physically proof-banked and merged through PR #80, but not requalified on `4ee07caf`, `17a948cf`, or the eventual frozen candidate;
- broader coalescing, power-loss, schema, reset, and time work remains open.

### RP2040 bridge

**Files:**

- `main/hal/rp2040_bridge.c` — about 1,389 lines
- `firmware/rp2040_sd_bridge/deskos_sd_bridge/deskos_sd_bridge.ino` — about 3,093 lines

The RP2040 owns physical SD. Current bridge firmware includes card-detect sampling, low-level SPI probes, FAT32 mount, directory creation, file protocol, atomic rename, diagnostics, and the new bounded sector-zero liveness verification. The exact bridge paired with `092293f` passed WP-01; future integrated and frozen release candidates must use checksum-bound bridge provenance and receive their own applicable qualification.

### Map

**Files:**

- `main/map/map_view_service.c`
- `main/storage/map_tile_store.c`

Confirmed:

- current-view-only plan;
- max visible 3×3 tiles;
- sequential fetch;
- explicit User-Agent;
- TLS certificate bundle and SNTP;
- 429/503 handling;
- cancellation;
- content/size/PNG validation;
- atomic SD cache;
- attribution metadata;
- PSRAM double-buffered render.

Open:

- exact hardware live fetch/render/cache/cancel proof;
- signed peer location markers;
- provider/cache lifecycle;
- Wi-Fi reconnect;
- Map requires ready SD cache for current implementation.

### Wi-Fi/BLE

**File:** `main/comms/connectivity_manager.c`

Wi-Fi station setup, saved profile, scan/status, and fail-closed startup exist. A complete bounded reconnect/backoff state machine is not evident. BLE is disabled in `sdkconfig.defaults` and remains a placeholder capability.

### UI

**File:** `main/ui/ui_phase1.c` — about 8,544 lines

Confirmed:

- many mature screens and simulator contracts;
- large global widget/modal/state surface;
- navigation, data access, actions, refresh, and styling mixed in one implementation;
- incremental controller extraction is necessary before adding the full remaining feature set.

### USB console

**File:** `main/comms/usb_console.c` — about 5,124 lines

The console is a major strength for deterministic automation but mixes parsing, dispatch, JSON, diagnostics, mutating controls, and test hooks. It should become a domain command registry and feed a bounded redacted event ring used by both USB and the requested UI Terminal.

### Release gate

**File:** `scripts/release_gate_audit_d1l.py` — about 3,430 lines

Confirmed:

- extensive exact-commit/evidence policy;
- current conformance closure deliberately false;
- current default helper peer resolves to COM11;
- this conflicts with the operator’s hard no-COM11 rule and must be removed.

### Partition table

**File:** `partitions_d1l.csv`

Current layout has a single large factory application and no `otadata`, `ota_0`, or `ota_1`. Release-grade OTA requires a partition/size/migration decision before implementation.

### Settings/time

**Files:** `main/app/settings_model.h/.c`

Confirmed:

- schema v7;
- identity/private key, Wi-Fi profile, radio/settings in NVS-backed model;
- migrations exist for older schemas;
- no complete channel/admin/timezone model;
- unknown future schema handling needs non-destructive quarantine;
- PR #120 now centralizes monotonic, wall, certificate-validity, and protocol clocks with reserve-before-use high water. Trusted SNTP admission, retained wall recovery, explicit legacy migration, and exact-device proof remain incomplete, so WP-12 and release closure are still false.

## External policy anchors

### OpenStreetMap Standard tiles

Official policy requires visible attribution, a distinct User-Agent, cache use, and no bulk/offline prefetch. It recommends avoiding a hard-coded provider URL. The current bounded Map foundation aligns with the important request limits but needs final provider/cache lifecycle documentation and proof.

### GitHub Actions

Official GitHub guidance states that a full-length action commit SHA is the immutable pinning mechanism. Current moving major action tags should be pinned before public release.

### ESP-IDF

ESP-IDF v5.5.4 is an official bug-fix release in the selected 5.5 line. The repository’s version and lock must still be proved on exact combined hardware and kept immutable in release metadata.

## Audit limitations

- The original 2026-07-12 audit performed no new physical flash or RF test. The post-audit WP-01 reconciliation above records later exact-source physical evidence and does not rewrite the original audit boundary.
- No claim from a predecessor SHA is treated as final release proof.
- GitHub source, history, issues, PRs, and workflow results were inspected through the connected GitHub/API tools because a direct local clone was unavailable in the audit environment.
- The roadmap therefore includes exact physical closure wherever source/CI cannot prove hardware behavior.
